This is a project that I did for my CMSC201 class. It is intended on recreating a simple compiler that takes in assembly-style commands and executes them.


It has various input files that have Assembly like instructions that do different function. 

Through this project I got an insight on how to think like a computer and match commands and actions in order to execute operations.
